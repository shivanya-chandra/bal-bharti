				The story, set in Detroit Michigan, follows three main characters,
				Connor, Markus, and Kara, each of them ultra-realistic androids that
				eventually gain free-will and sentience along with many other androids
				in the city. The story focuses on the possible humanity of the sentient
				androids, and what the androids should do with their newfound sentience.
				Detroit gives you many options to alter the story, with branching paths
				and narratives that changes with the choices that you make. Something as
				simple as choosing to play the piano as opposed to reading a book could
				have lasting effects on the story.
			</p>
			<p>
				The story of Detroit: Become Human is obviously impossible with current
				technology and based we may never reach a true human-like artificial
				intelligence, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t gain anything from it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rene Descartes famously coined, “Cogito, ergo sum,” which translates to,
				“I think, therefore I am.” The phrase is one of the most famous
				philosophical sayings along with sayings like Nietzche’s “God is dead
				and we have killed him,” and Socrates’ “An unexamined life is not worth
				living.” Descartes’ saying has long been theorized to aim to solve
				questions of reality, humanity, identity, consciousness, and meaning,
				and is essential when it comes to examining the deeper meaning of
				Detroit: Become Human.
			</p>
			<p>
				Human identity and consciousness have been a consistent point of
				contention for most philosophers since the days of Socrates because what
				exactly makes us, us? Look to the Ship of Theseus, a philosophical
				thought experiment in which every piece of a ship through wear and tear
				is eventually replaced on a ship, and then a new ship is eventually made
				from the discarded parts. The thought experiment then poses a question.
				What ship is the original ship? Think of us like billions of walking
				ships of Theseus, because in a similar way our bodies over a period of
				seven years replace every single cell that was previously there. After a
				period of seven years, not a single cell in your body is the same as it
				was seven years prior, therefore are we the same person? Most people
				would say, of course, that obviously, we’re the same, but why? Here we
				circle back to Descartes, “I think, therefore I am.”
			</p>
			<p>
				So by following this logic, what makes an android in Detroit: Become
				Human any less human than a regular person? The androids have wants and
				needs, regrets and sadness, love and happiness, they have good and bad
				memories and have goals looking toward the future. An interesting
				wrinkle in this is the fact that the androids were created by humans,
				but to the religious among us how is that any different than a divine
				creator?
			</p>
			So then how should one treat a being that thinks and feels like a human?
			The question of morality centering on the treatment of artificial
			intelligence has its roots in human history of mistreatment based on
			physical differences. In Detroit: Become Human the androids are disposable
			tools treated as less than human very similar to American slavery and the
			years of segregation following the end of slavery. But the androids strive
			for life, they want to stay alive, take, for example, the moment in which
			one of the main characters, Markus, is left to rot in an android scrap
			yard. Any of the androids that are still functioning in the scrap yard are
			wandering, scared, and even begging to stay alive. Another of the main
			androids, Kara, is taken home by her owner, Todd, who threatens and
			berates her, and even before her sentience Kara displays some forms of
			fear. Androids themselves are ruthlessly mistreated by their human owners
			even with the androids maintaining some basic form of sentience before the
			story kicks off. This harkens back to American slavery, and slavery
			abroad, with very sentient, very intelligent humans being treated as lowly
			as cattle, being treated as disposable as property.
